# First Unreal Project
This is my first project that I have made in the Unreal Engine. I followed a course on the basics of the Unreal engine. Whilst following this course, I made a simple game which goasl is to collect orbs to open the end of the level while passing obstacles and avoiding ennemies. This project helped me to learn many of the basics of the Unreal Engine, such as the blueprint system, the different types of actors, the basic of creating an HUD, etc. It is quite simple and barebones, but, in my personnal opinion, a good introduction to the Unreal.
